        <td>Develop my knowledge of computing in general</td>
        <td>In pursuit of more computing knowledge I joined Devsoc. This introduced me to like minded individuals who held a wealth of information that I could refer from. Further by taking the Github basics course I was able to setup my Github account and learn the basics of using the industry standard site.</td>

        <td>Develop knowledge on mainframe computers</td>
        <td>I participated in the IBM ZXplore event to broaden my knowledge when working with mainframes. I attended the devsoc workshop regarding this event which helped me understand the uses and technologies behind mainframes more indepth and was helpful for future consideration.</td>

        <td>Devsoc Project Revil first year challenge.</td>
        <td>While this was a event I joined for fun the experience of using different encoding methods such as base 8, 16, 2 as well as using ciphers such as the monk cipher was an eye opening experience. Unfortunately I was unable to complete the challenges making it to only stage three however with the knowledge I have accumulated I am confident that I will succeed next time!</td>

This workshop showed me how to more effectively use the library resources as well as use databases to find information. All in all a very informative session.</td>

        <td>Learning how to Drive.</td>
        <td>I have taken multiple driving lessons over the course of this term, in the hopes that I will be able to develop my skill enough to obtain my drivers licence. The experience of driving in a car was very exciting, I have been improving at a steady pace and hope to do my exam soon (as of writing).</td>

            To help increase my portfolio of languages for my professional development.
            </td>
        <td>I read through the rust official documentation. I learned to install rust, wrote multiple programs including a number guessing program, and learned the basic paradigms surrounding the language.
            Rust is one of the more in demand languages in the industry.
